land has long been the meeting place of many cultures. Textiles and their stories reveal the ways in which cultural traditions adapt and evolve as diverse communities come into contact with new environments. &#34;Crosscurrents&#34; explores ongoing cultural exchanges and interactions between First Peoples, settler Canadians and newcomers over the last two centuries.

Plus, as runners cross the finish line, they'll be able to enjoy a glass of bubbly to get the party started before the post-race concert. The Toronto Island is a unique spot for running events; it's a short ferry ride away and offers a great view of the city as you wind your way along the paved trails!","orgEmail":"info@gwnevents.com","otherCostInfo":"Participation fees vary - for more information, please visit our website!","features":{"Onsite Food and Beverages":false,"Public Washrooms":true},"categoryString":"Family\/Children,Running,Walking","themeString":"","admissionType":"Rng","isWidgetEvent":false,"accessibility":"full","subsetCalendarString":"","allDay":false,"theme":[],"image":{"fileSize":88387,"fileType":"image\/jpeg","binId":"hYmaNzjiOho0FLyD_h8HaQ","fileName":"Diva's-Half-Marathon-5k-Toronto-Island-Logo.jpg","altText":"Toronto Divas Run Logo","url":"\/webapps\/CC\/fileAPI\/edc_eventcal\/Diva's-Half-Marathon-5k-Toronto-Island-Logo_hYmaNzjiOho0FLyD_h8HaQ.jpg"},"reservationsRequired":"Yes","recId":"mEyDnZDw0SabISqUeSHVUA","orgName":"GWN Events","endDateTime":null,"cost":{"to":125,"from":60},"expectedAvg":4000,"eventPhone":"4169628899","category":[{"name":"Family\/Children"},{"name":"Running"},{"name":"Walking"}],"admin":{"reviewerComments":"KR - NOV 4TH VH 18\/11\/06","updateTimestamp":"2018-11-06T19:28:10.503Z","newsletterCategory":[],"includeInNewsletter":false,"newsletterSubcategory":[],"featuredEvent":"false","approvedTimestamp":"2018-11-06T19:28:10.504Z","subsetCalendar":[],"approvedBy":"vhortig","updatedBy":"vhortig"},"contactName":"Noah Mar","reservation":{"website":"https:\/\/www.runlikeadiva.com\/Events\/TorontoIsland.htm","email":""},"freeEvent":"No","eventName":"Divas Half Marathon and 5K on Toronto Island"}},{"calEvent":{"orgType":"Non-Profit","startDate":"2019-03-02T05:00:00.000Z","eventPhoneExt":"2","thumbImage":{"fileSize":26089,"fileType":"image\/png","binId":"I7rh0eR2Xj7WdqFWsc67xw","fileName":"26 Letter Dance_HiRes 1200 px_th.png","url":"\/webapps\/CC\/fileAPI\/edc_eventcal\/26 Letter Dance_HiRes 1200 px_th_I7rh0eR2Xj7WdqFWsc67xw.png"},"timeInfo":"Running time approximately 65 minutes.","orgAddress":"165 Front Street East","terms":"agree","endDate":"2019-03-16T04:00:00.000Z","frequency":"dates","orgPhoneExt":"2","partnerType":"producedby","eventWebsite":"https:\/\/www.youngpeoplestheatre.ca\/shows-tickets\/the-26-letter-dance\/","orgPhone":"4168622222","dates":[{"startDateTime":"2019-03-02T19:30:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-09T19:30:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-10T18:30:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-12T15:00:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-12T18:30:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-13T18:30:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-14T18:30:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-15T17:00:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-16T18:30:00.000Z"}],"locations":[{"id":"e8c81110-8ef1-32be-3584-f9db87e2baca","coords":{"lng":-79.36829119999999,"lat":43.6500103},"address":"165 Front St E, Toronto, ON M5A 3Z4, Canada","geoCoded":true,"locationType":[{"type":"marker"}],"locationName":"Young People's Theatre","type":"marker"}],"description":"Created, directed and co-choreographed by H&#233;l&#232;ne Langevin&#10;Co-choreographed by Jean-Fran&#231;ois L&#233;gar&#233;&#10;&#10;This inventive, interactive show inspires kids to dance to the beat of their own drum &#8211; based on the alphabet!

This yearly event is held to honour police officers in the Province of Ontario who lost their lives in the line of duty. All names will be read aloud beginning at 10am and police pipe bands will lead officers from across Ontario, Canada and the United States in their march around Queen's Park, arriving at the Memorial shortly before 11am for the official start of the Ceremony of Remembrance. The Ontario Police Memorial Foundation (OPMF), host of the annual Memorial Service, continues with its research to fulfill its goal of ensuring that every fallen officer from Ontario will not be forgotten.","orgEmail":"thurst@tpa.ca","categoryString":"Charity\/Cause","themeString":"","isWidgetEvent":false,"accessibility":"full","partnerName":"Ontario Police Memorial Foundation","subsetCalendarString":"","theme":[],"image":{"fileSize":183322,"fileType":"image\/jpeg","binId":"oLBZM2Zv1xfoHzQIeYlVdQ","fileName":"OPMFPoster2019.jpg","altText":"2019 OPMF Ceremony Of Remembrance Poster","url":"\/webapps\/CC\/fileAPI\/edc_eventcal\/OPMFPoster2019_oLBZM2Zv1xfoHzQIeYlVdQ.jpg"},"reservationsRequired":"No","recId":"IdAJCPULx1fX5RW0qwyY5Q","orgName":"Ontario Police Memorial Foundation","endDateTime":"2019-05-05T16:00:00.000Z","expectedAvg":3000,"eventPhone":"4164914301","category":[{"name":"Charity\/Cause"}],"shortDescription":"This yearly event is held to honour police officers in the Province of Ontario who lost their lives in the line of duty.","admin":{"reviewerComments":"rh 02\/08\/2019","updateTimestamp":"2019-02-08T22:08:43.424Z","newsletterCategory":[{"value":"Festivals and Events"}],"includeInNewsletter":true,"newsletterSubcategory":[],"featuredEvent":false,"approvedTimestamp":"2019-02-08T22:08:43.425Z","subsetCalendar":[],"approvedBy":"rhortig","updatedBy":"rhortig"},"contactName":"Tanis Hurst","freeEvent":"Yes","eventName":"Ontario Police Memorial Foundation Ceremony of Remembrance"}},{"calEvent":{"orgType":"Public Agency","startDate":"2019-03-11T04:00:00.000Z","thumbImage":{"fileSize":43489,"fileType":"image\/png","binId":"dIPBWgGL_m_bZJz4VvsWrg","fileName":"FY_MarchBreak_th.png","url":"\/webapps\/CC\/fileAPI\/edc_eventcal\/FY_MarchBreak_th_dIPBWgGL_m_bZJz4VvsWrg.png"},"orgAddress":"CH 6W","isCityEvent":true,"terms":"agree","endDate":"2019-03-17T04:00:00.000Z","frequency":"dates","partnerType":"none","eventWebsite":"http:\/\/www.toronto.ca\/fortyork","orgPhone":"4163924467","dates":[{"startDateTime":"2019-03-11T14:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2019-03-11T20:00:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-12T14:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2019-03-12T20:00:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-13T14:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2019-03-13T20:00:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-14T14:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2019-03-14T20:00:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-15T14:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2019-03-15T20:00:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-16T14:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2019-03-16T21:00:00.000Z"},{"startDateTime":"2019-03-17T14:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2019-03-17T21:00:00.000Z"}],"eventEmail":"fortyork@toronto.ca","locations":[{"id":"8c2e8579-fe12-4fed-8b33-f5c32d135b20","coords":{"lng":-79.40664609999999,"lat":43.6374082},"address":"250 Fort York Blvd, Toronto, ON M5V 3K9, Canada","geoCoded":true,"locationType":[{"type":"marker"}],"locationName":"Fort York National Historic Site","type":"marker"}],"description":"Bring your family down to Fort York National Historic Site for a day of March Break adventure!

Each of his clients wants something, driven by a deep desire, a desire that is difficult to realize, if not impossible. There is however a price to pay for his services. Because the choices and the consequences concern only his clients, it is up to them to choose their boundaries, defining what is bad and what is good, completely free to choose their own fate. It is these visitors in need of miracles who return to tell how their lives proceed, weaving a plot in which their stories intertwine and not even this humble intermediary will succeed to remain impassive.","orgEmail":"nquercia@icff.ca","categoryString":"Film","themeString":"","isWidgetEvent":false,"accessibility":"full","admissionType":"GA","subsetCalendarString":"","theme":[],"image":{"fileSize":117552,"fileType":"image\/jpeg","binId":"QW0skfypw1Dk36v2QsqRsA","fileName":"place.jpg","altText":"The Place official movie poster","url":"\/webapps\/CC\/fileAPI\/edc_eventcal\/place_QW0skfypw1Dk36v2QsqRsA.jpg"},"reservationsRequired":"Yes","recId":"hWly5PE$1wvGMReY6IwJVA","orgName":"Italian Contemporary Film Festival","cost":{"ga":16.01},"endDateTime":"2019-04-13T03:00:00.000Z","category":[{"name":"Film"}],"contactName":"Natalie Quercia","admin":{"reviewerComments":"ms030319","updateTimestamp":"2019-03-03T20:54:38.919Z","newsletterCategory":[],"includeInNewsletter":false,"newsletterSubcategory":[],"featuredEvent":"false","approvedTimestamp":"2019-03-03T20:54:38.919Z","subsetCalendar":[],"approvedBy":"msilver2","updatedBy":"msilver2"},"reservation":{"website":"https:\/\/www.universe.com\/events\/the-place-movie-toronto-tickets-toronto-H6L72J"},"freeEvent":"No","eventName":"ICFF Monthly Screening - The Place"}},{"calEvent":{"orgType":"Private\/Business","startDate":"2019-03-13T04:00:00.000Z","thumbImage":{"fileSize":78418,"fileType":"image\/png","binId":"5aQGgfqi-ELlGMnJqqZTgw","fileName":"WUWUTO-SQUARE_th.png","url":"\/webapps\/CC\/fileAPI\/edc_eventcal\/WUWUTO-SQUARE_th_5aQGgfqi-ELlGMnJqqZTgw.png"},"timeInfo":"Doors Open 8 p.m.&#10;Show Starts 9 p.m.","startDateTime":"2019-03-14T01:00:00.000Z","orgAddress":"79 Richmond St E","terms":"agree","endDate":"2019-03-13T04:00:00.000Z","frequency":"once","partnerType":"none","eventWebsite":"https:\/\/www.vongshow.com\/index.php\/event\/what-up-what-up-toronto-2\/","orgPhone":"6477847504","dates":[{"startDateTime":"2019-03-14T01:00:00.000Z","endDateTime":"2019-03-14T03:00:00.000Z"}],"locations":[{"id":"ba41e808-9308-9c1f-2c2f-ad4a5541071d","coords":{"lng":-79.3948236,"lat":43.6491716},"$$hashKey":"object:14334","address":"332 Queen St W, Toronto, ON M5V 2A2, Canada","geoCoded":true,"locationType":[{"type":"marker"}],"locationName":"Rivoli","type":"marker"}],"eventEmail":"vongshow@icloud.com","description":"Toronto's urban comedy showcase.

Glass' distinct photographic style is characterized by extensive digital embellishment of textures and colours to enhance the emotion and geometry of flowers. Recently, the artist&#8217;s large-scale flower images expanded into the third dimension through advanced 3-D printing technology. Inspired by 17th century European flower paintings, the artist contends that contemporary digital photographers are also painters who manipulate pixels instead of oils.","orgEmail":"lcolumbus@ocadu.ca","features":{"Bike Racks":true,"Onsite Food and Beverages":true,"Paid Parking":true,"Public Washrooms":true},"categoryString":"Arts\/Exhibits","themeString":"","isWidgetEvent":false,"accessibility":"full","partnerName":"Carlos Fernandez, Nexus Investments, Scotiabank CONTACT Photography Festival","subsetCalendarString":"","theme":[],"image":{"fileSize":149318,"fileType":"image\/jpeg","binId":"bFD7atB5Cw2sgiefWEZP4A","fileName":"tm glass header.jpg","credit":"T.M.
